COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the COVID-19 pandemic using various Python data science libraries. The analysis covers state-wise trends in India, global case comparisons, and time-series forecasting of the spread.





### Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preparation: Loading datasets, handling missing values, and merging geographical coordinates for mapping.



Interactive Visualizations: Utilizing Plotly and Matplotlib for dynamic bar charts, scatter plots, and time-series analysis.






Geospatial Analysis: Implementing Choropleth maps and Folium-based circle markers to visualize the density of cases across different regions.




Comparative Analysis: Side-by-side growth comparisons of total cases in countries like India, Italy, S. Korea, and Wuhan.


### Tech Stack

Language: Python 


Environment: Jupyter Notebook 

Libraries:

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical analysis.



Matplotlib & Seaborn: Static data visualization.




Plotly & Cufflinks: Interactive charts and geographical maps.




Folium: Geospatial data visualization.

### Data Insights (Sample Analysis)
As of the data captured in this analysis:


Total Cases in India: Approximately 729 cases were recorded across various states.



Most Affected States: Maharashtra and Kerala showed the highest concentration of total confirmed cases.



Global Trends: The analysis tracks the exponential growth of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time, specifically focusing on the early 2020 surge.


### Project Structure
Data Import &amp; Cleaning: Scripts to load .xlsx and .csv files and prepare dataframes.




Exploratory Data Analysis: Calculation of active cases and mortality rates.



Visualizations:

State-wise bar and scatter plots.


Global density heatmaps using Mapbox.

Multi-country comparative subplots.
